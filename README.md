# UART_servo
This is a pet project of making a uart-controlled 360-degree servo out of a fun little brushless geared motor I found on Aliexpress.

The 3d models were designed in Freecad, so I added .FCstd files for easy import to Freecad, if anybody uses it as well. (I had trouble importing .step in Freecad for some reason)
